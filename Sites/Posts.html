				CSS: Display and Position

			<div class="post-content-subheader" onmousedown="return false">

			</div>
			
			<div class="post-content-body">
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					There are many, many valid values for the <span class="code css">display</span> property,
					while there are at least six values possible for the <span class="code css">position</span> property.
					However, I'll summarize them to the essential things you'll need to know!
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">				
					One important component for web layouts is that there are four essential values for 
					<span class="code css">display</span>. By default, all elements are set to 
					<span class="code css">display: inline;</span> by default. However, the 
					<span class="code html">&lt;div&gt;</span> tags created	in the document are automatically 
					set to <span class="code css">display: block;</span>. 
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="code css">display: block;</span> is the default setting for the 
							<span class="code html">&lt;div&gt;</span> tags. Elements possessing this property always start
							a new line, unlike elements with <span class="code css">display: inline;</span> which always 
							takes as much space on the same line as possible.
						</li>

						<li>
							<span class="code css">display: flex;</span> follows a flexbox model: when its 
							children-elements have no specified width or height, they will occupy as much space in the
							viewport width or height (of your device) as possible, even compressing them so much.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span class="code css">display: grid;</span> much like the previous type follows a box (i.e.
							grid model). However, unlike flexbox, you have an easier access to control the measurements
							of the layout via rows and columns.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span class="code css">display: none;</span> removes the element from the site.
							The website will act as if the element really wasn't there, in contrast to an element
							set in <span class="code css">visibility: none;</span> where the element will not show
							but still retains some position. That's how it is, sadly.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					The other important component is the five essential values of the <span class="code css">position</span>
					property. This gives you control over certain elements; with this property, you can decide whether
					the element always sticks to the screen or fulfill the want of elements following some straight line.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="code css">position: static;</span> is the default setting for all elements. This
							is the only value of <span class="code css">position</span> that is not affected by the
							<span class="code css">top</span>, <span class="code css">bottom</span>, 
							<span class="code css">left</span>, and <span class="code css">right</span> properties, which
							we'll collectively call positional properties.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span class="code css">position: fixed;</span> forces the element to be placed relative to
							the viewport or what you can see on screen. Elements possessing this property will always
							stick on screen even with all the scrolling action.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span class="code css">position: relative;</span> acts like <span class="code css">position: static;</span>
							by default. However, it can be affected by the positional properties mentioned above. These properties
							will nudge the element to some direction relative to its original location. For example, an object
							having a relative position and <span class="code css">top: 10px;</span> will be found 10px below
							its previous location.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span class="code css">position: absolute;</span> enables a position relative to a non-static ancestor
							or parent element. If there are no such ancestors, then it will position relative to the document body.
							For example, an object having an absolute position, no non-static ancestors (or no position was set), and
							<span class="code css">left: 25px;</span> will be found 25px away from the left side of the document.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span class="code css">position: sticky;</span> will initially act like
							<span class="code css">position: relative;</span> until a certain extent is reach via scrolling where
							it acts like <span class="code css">position: fixed;</span>.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					This may seem off-topic, but I'll discuss it anyway! How would we even center some objects with all these 
					<span class="code css">display</span> and <span class="code css">position</span> properties in the equation?
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					<ul>
						<li>
							With <span class="code css">display: flex;</span> as a setting, you can center its children-elements
							by including <span class="code css">justify-content: center;</span> and
							<span class="code css">align-items: center;</span>. Do note, that the default value is
							<span class="code css">flex-direction: row;</span>, so <span class="code css">justify-content</span>
							and <span class="code css">align-items</span> would work on an x-axis and y-axis, respectively. It
							will work oppositely for <span class="code css">flex-direction: column;</span>.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							With <span class="code css">display: grid;</span> as a setting, use
							<span class="code css">justify-items: center;</span> and <span class="code css">align-items: center;</span>.
							It will center the children-elements along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							For centering an object using <span class="code css">position: absolute;</span>, consider first if it's
							going to be relative to a parent container or the whole site. By simply typing
							<span class="code css">position: relative;</span> (or any non-static value) to some parent container,
							you will force the target object to position relatively within the parent container. Then, 
							<span class="code css">top: 50%;</span> and/or <span class="code css">left: 50%;</span>. Define some
							width and height, and set the <span class="code css">margin-top</span> and/or 
							<span class="code css">margin-left</span> to the negative half of the defined height and/or width, all
							respectively. 
						</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="content-paragraph">
					You must have already visited the Splash Page of this website. Did you come across a background image? The fact
					is I didn't use the <span class="code css">background-image</span> property. If it was neat and you'd love to
					know how it was made, keep scrolling!
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					The visual effects you must have seen are the blur effect provided by the <span class="code css">filter</span>
					property. While <span class="code css">filter</span> has several values, like <span class="code css">display</span>,
					we'll go around four possible values. Do note that this is more commonly used for 
					<span class="code html">&lt;img&gt;</span> elements.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="code css">filter: blur(<b>&lt;length&gt;</b>);</span> adds a blur on the element. The length defines
							"how many pixels blend into each other." Although the parameter is length, percentage values aren't accepted.
							Also, if you use a small value for the length parameter (in pixels), and you zoomed out, the element will appear
							as if it wasn't blurred. However, if you zoom in, the element appears to be more blurred. The blur effect is
							good if you want to emphasize some text directly in front of the element (usually picture). It's also good if
							you want to cast some mystery to the element. When you blur a picture, a margin of white is created. You'll know
							later how to resolve it!
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span class="code css">filter: grayscale(<b>&lt;percent&gt;</b>);</span> adds a gray effect (or black and white effect)
							to the image. If you want a touch of 1900s to your pictures, try this out! If you want to add some memorial element
							to that element, try this out. The percent determines how "gray" the picture is supposed to be. A value of 100% (or
							1) means that the element is fully gray.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span class="code css">filter: invert(<b>&lt;percent&gt;</b>);</span> allows you to control how much of the colors of
							the elementare inverted. A value of zero doesn't change the tone of the element, while a value of 100% (or 1) completely
							inverts the element.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span class="code css">filter: opacity(<b>&lt;percent&gt;</b>);</span> adjusts the transparency of the element.
							To be quite honest, the <span class="code css">opacity</span> is more frequently used. They have the same mechanics:
							no negative values allowed, values are between zero and one. A value of zero means that the element cannot be seen
							since it's totally transparent, though it's still in place according to the document file, unlike
							<span class="code css">display: none;</span>. Use this if you want some "slightly better" transparency.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					Now, as mentioned earlier, some margin of white appears if you use <span class="code css">filter: blur(<b>&lt;length&gt;</b>);</span>
					on pictures. How do we resolve this? One way of effectively removing them is by using 
					<span class="code css">transform: scale(<b>&lt;multiplier&gt;</b>)</span> on the element with the filter. There are more
					values (and parameters) for the <span class="code css">transform</span> property; I'll give two examples and some of their
					variations.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="code css">transform: scale(<b>&lt;multiplier&gt;</b>)</span>, in simple terms, zooms the image. Without any
							restrictions on the parent container where the element is, it can actually go over and overlap. An easy solution is to set
							a <span class="code css">height</span> or <span class="code css">width</span> and add 
							<span class="code css">overflow: hidden;</span> on the parent container. This <span class="code css">transform</span> value
							is a shortcut to <span class="code css">scaleX</span> and <span class="code css">scaleY</span>. If two parameters are placed
							instead of one for the <span class="code css"><b>&lt;multiplier&gt;</b></span>, the first parameter stretches the x-component of
							the element, and the second parameter stretches the y-component.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<span class="code css">transform: rotate(<b>&lt;angle&gt;</b>)</span> rotates the element along a 2D plane. The 
							<span class="code css"><b>&lt;angle&gt;</b></span> unit could be in degrees (deg), turns, radians (rad), or gradians (grad). 
							One full rotation is equal to <span class="code css">(<b>360deg</b>)</span>, 
							<span class="code css">(<b>1turn</b>)</span>, <span class="code css">(<b>2&pi;rad</b>)</span>, or
							<span class="code css">(<b>400grad</b>)</span>.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					I found a demo for the <span class="code css">transform</span> property at 
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform">https://developer.mozilla.org/</a>! Also, do check out these links 
					for a more expanded discussion on both of these properties.

				CSS: Pseudoclasses
			</div>
			
			<div class="post-content-subheader" onmousedown="return false">

			</div>
			
			<div class="post-content-body">
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					When we make websites, we should usually aim to make it more interactive. This is where
					pseudoclasses come in. We use pseudoclasses when we want to select some certain state
					of an element, like when we hover or when we click it. We can also use them if we want
					to select certain elements, especially when picking odd-numbered elements or the last
					of the element within a container. Pseudoclasses are not really classes (hence the
					prefix pseudo-) but they do function well as selectors.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					Let's first discuss pseudoclasses related to links or <span class="code html">&lt;a&gt;</span>
					tags with <span class="code html">href</span> attribute as well as the special states of the
					elements. This category is called dynamic pseudoclasses. There are four of them here.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					<ul>
						<li>
							The <span class="code css">:link</span> pseudoclass only selects the
							<span class="code html">&lt;a href=<b>"[someClassName]"</b>&gt;</span>. This is useful
							for targetting elements that may lead somewhere outside the document page (or even local
							links, like <span class="code html">href=<b>#[someIdName]</b></span>).
						</li>
						
						<li>
							The <span class="code css">:visited</span> pseudoclass selects the 
							<span class="code html">&lt;a&gt;</span> tags that have been clicked (specifically, visited) 
							previously. Normally—hen there are no CSS associated with these
							<span class="code html">&lt;a&gt;</span>—when links are clicked, the color changes from blue
							to purple. 
						</li>
						
						<li>
							The <span class="code css">:active</span> pseudoclass selects the state of an element when
							it is being clicked. This is most likely the second most used pseudoclass in this category. 
						</li>
						
						<li>
							The <span class="code css">:hover</span> pseudoclass selects the state of an element when the
							cursor is directly above the element. Generally, this is the most used pseudoclass.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					There is also another type of pseudoclasses called the structural pseudoclasses which select elements
					relative to their order within a parent container. By default, the count goes from top to bottom, or
					cascading (hence CSS). 
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					<ul>
						<li>
							The <span class="code css">:first-child</span> selects the first of that certain class within
							the parent container. In other words, it selects the top element (based on the coding of HTML)
							with that class.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							The <span class="code css">:last-child</span> selects the bottom element with the said class.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							The <span class="code css">:nth-child(<b>[expression]</b>)</span> allows you to select elements
							using an algebraic expression. This is best when you want to select elements systematically (or
							for every nth element) or when you want to have different effects on odd and even. You can even
							use it if you want to select the first n elements.
						</li>
						
						<li>
							The <span class="code css">:not()</span> selects the state that is not indicated within the
							parenthesis. To make this clearer, putting <span class="code css">:not(:hover)</span> will
							select the events wherein the element isn't hovered. 
							<span class="code css">div:not(.active)</span> selects all the <span class="code html">&lt;div&gt;</span>
							tags that do not have the class "active." This pseudoclass cannot be nested; 
							<span class="code css">div:not(:not)</span> does not work!
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					Here are other CSS pseudoclasses you may find useful especially in using <span class="code html">&lt;input&gt;</span>
					tags.

					With regards to synergizing these pseudoclasses with JavaScript, you can actually perform actions if there 
					are more classes added to a certain element. With JavaScript, you can change the class name of an element using the
					<span class="code js">.className</span> property. Remember, the styles applied on the element will depend on the
					specificity. For instance, an element with <span class="code html">class="active round"</span> will have a yellow
					background color under <span class="code css">.active.round</span> rather than the red background under
					<span class="code css">.round</span> since the former was more specific.

				<div class="content-paragraph">
					Every time something happens, that's an event. Click an element, that's an event. Hover over
					an element, that's an event. When you don't hover over an element, that's still an event.
					Want something to happen when some event happens? This is where JavaScript comes in!
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					Let's not use lists, this time. We'll go over through some of the most commonly used event
					types. How the user triggers these event types is pretty much self-explanatory, so instead
					we'll also go to the best examples on executing these events.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					The first type is <span class="code html">onclick</span>, undoubtedly one of the
					most dynamic event types. This event is triggered when the user clicks on the element.
					The perfect example for using this event type is using sliders, where the parameters are
					numbers which affect how far from the left the slider goes. Oh, the format for
					calling a function is <span class="code html">functionName(<b>[parameter]</b>)</span>.
					That's it; <span class="code html">onclick</span> is so dynamic, it can be used for a lot
					of many things.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					The second type is <span class="code html">onmouseenter</span>. This event functions a lot
					like <span class="code css">:hover</span>, except that it only occurs once the cursor "enters"
					an element. A more repetitive version of this event is <span class="code html">onmouseover</span>,
					where every time you move the mouse within the element, the event occurs. Think of this event
					as <span class="code html">onclick</span> without the need to click. Anyway, the gist of this is that
					<span class="code html">onmouseenter</span> function acts like <span class="code css">:hover</span> and
					is mostly useful when you want to create interactions like lighting up the navigation tab that corresponds
					to the position of the cursor on the page.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					The third type is <span class="code html">onmouseleave</span> which is the opposite of
					<span class="code html">onmouseenter</span>. The former works similarly to <span class="code html">onmouseout</span>,
					which is the opposite to <span class="code html">onmouseover</span>. Think of both of the outgoing events
					as <span class="code css">:not(:hover)</span>. Normally, when using these types, the effects revert to normalcy,
					or not in hover-mode.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					The fourth type is <span class="code html">onload</span> which triggers actions when the document page is
					completely done loading. I recommend using this if you want to randomly generate some content in your page
					upon loading.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					The fifth and final type I'm going to discuss is <span class="code html">onbeforeunload</span>, which is mostly
					used to warn the user before leaving the page and going to an outside link.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">

					Appending. Lowending. We name it! (Boo, the author sucks.)
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					Appending is an action where you get to insert a usually newly-created element from JavaScript
					to HTML. The format of appending is <span class="code js">parentContainer.append(child)</span>.
					You can also replace the "parentContainer" part with <span class="code js">$(<b>[selector]</b>)</span>
					to insert an element to another certain element without needing to create a variable getting a
					certain ID. The format of the selector is similar to the way you target something in CSS. You
					could have <span class="code css">div#active.round</span> as a selector.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					One way of using <span class="code js">append</span> is creating custom alerts. These alerts should
					already have some sort of template by using CSS. You must also have another container with an id or
					class although the former is more preferred. Using appending, we can insert the alert to that container.
					We can also append some text to the container, although this is less used.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					Appending is a very useful for adding stuff while requiring interaction. Check this 
					<a href="https://blog.devcenter.co/appending-in-javascript-via-jquery-d8e7544479e6"> link </a> for an 
					in-depth info regarding <span class="code js">append</span>.

					Let's start with the cliché quote that pictures paint a thou- okay, that's too repetitive.
					I guess I'll start discussing on getting good images straight away. However, there'll be
					a catch when getting high-quality images though. Keep scrolling if you want to take the
					small risk. (It's not really a risk since it's part of loading a website.)
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					The best avenue to get good images, for a starting point, is Google Images. You can reliably
					search images and even specify the quality of the picture you're looking more. You can even
					specify if you're looking for "HD" pictures. I recommend using higher dimensions because,
					from my experience, using image that display as large elements on website is more likely 
					to provide high resolution. However, this applies more to wallpapers. If you can apply
					that to other pictures that are non-wallpapers, it would still display an awesome effect.
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					Getting relevant images is also key to a successful delivery of your website. Though, don't
					stress too much on relevant and make your pictures match each other. Too much pictures of
					the same topic can be boring and unoriginal. While too less doesn't provide much detail,
					too much isn't good, either. 
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-paragraph">
					Lastly, in terms of file type, use JPGs for photographs and PNGs for graphics, that's it!
					Hopefully, you'll find good pictures for your site. Sorry for the lack of pictures in these
					articles since I really didn't find relevant images. Anyways, stay safe and healthy, guys!
